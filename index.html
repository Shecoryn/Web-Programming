  One thing that I have always cherished being a part of was being in jazz band. I played the tenor saxophone which is a major instrument in the group.
  Besides band, I have also tried to get involved with LGBTQ+ communities while being in college. I had became a member of Delta Lambda Phi Social Fraternity which is an
  organization created by gay men for all men. If you would like to have more details on these topics or other topics I am interested in,
